<h2> Artificial intelligence advantages: </h2>

There are many advantages and benefits of using artificial intelligence, including:
<ul>

<li>Permanent work:</li>
This is through the possibility that machines can operate continuously without feeling fatigue or fatigue, and that they can always produce without looking at the time or conditions surrounding work. Everyday life-critical applications: AI provides many applications that are becoming critical to human everyday life, and the smartphone and its diverse intelligent systems such as GPS are one of the most prominent examples of human need for different AI applications.

<li>Using AI to deliver Services:</li>
Many large organizations have relied on artificial intelligence systems to provide services to their clients rather than traditional employees.
<li>Eliminate redundant work:</li>
AI systems can be used to do routine work that requires the same mechanism at a time. These systems can also be used to carry out actions that may pose a danger to human life.
<li>Medical care delivery:</li>
There are many AI systems that provide medical care to humans, through surgical simulators, those that help detect neurological disorders or those that allow the patient to know the side effects of medicines. Also, it is necessary to mention applications of radiosurgery that have helped to eradicate tumors without harming the surrounding healthy tissues.
<li>Ability to process a huge amount of data:</li>
AI systems can handle, store, and process a huge amount of data.
<li>Accuracy and reduce margin of error:</li>
Human use of AI systems reduces the error rate that can occur during tasks, except for the high accuracy of performing these tasks.
<li>Doing the hard work:</li>
AI systems can do things that humans can do, such as excavations and exploration of hard-to-reach places like the ocean floor.
<li>Do not arbitrate the emotion: </li>
Unlike humans, AI is not affected by any emotions that can hinder the workflow, these systems are not mundative but work in a logical way of thinking, making them able to make the right decisions within a short time.
<ul>

<h2> Artificial intelligence disadvantages: </h2>
There are many disadvantages to using AI, including:
<ul>

<li>The high cost of using, updating, and maintaining AI systems.
 </li>
<li>Artificial intelligence systems are not aware of human ethics and values, and these systems lack the ability to make appropriate judgments. It is only interested in doing what it was designed to do without looking at what was right and wrong in carrying out the tasks.
 </li>
<li>The inability of AI systems to change and develop their operating system if they receive the same data every time, which may make them useless at some point.
 </li>
<li>AI systems lack responsiveness to conditions and changes in the work environment, and their inability to innovate as humans can. Many workers and employees are laid off by the use and reliance of artificial intelligence systems instead of
human</li>
