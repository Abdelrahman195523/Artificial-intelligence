<h2> History of Artificial intelligance :</h2>
The term artificial intelligence (AI) began in the 1950s, and in the 1950s, when Turing offered what it called "Turing Test", which means assessing intelligence on a computer, and classifying it as intelligent if it were able to simulate the human mind. One year after Turing's test, the first AI-based program was created by Christopher Strachey, who was head of programming research at Oxford University, who was able to run: Checkers via computer and development, and then, Anthony Oettinger of Cambridge, designed a simulated experience with a computer for human shopping in more than one store, which was designed to measure the computer's learning ability, this was the first successful experience The concept of artificial intelligence was officially proclaimed in 1956 at Dartmouth College, but it has not made any progress for nearly 20 years, possibly because of the limited computing capabilities that were then available. In 1979, Stanford, the first computer-driven vehicle, was built in 1997, and the first computer to beat a human chess rival, and the pace of acceleration in artificial intelligence began at the beginning of the 21st century, so that interactive robots became available in stores. It is even more so that a robot interacts with different emotions through facial expressions and other robots that have become difficult tasks such as Nomados, who search for and explore for remote places in the Antarctic, and locate meteoroids in the region.
