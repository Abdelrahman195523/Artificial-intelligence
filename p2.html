<h2> Types of Artificial intelligance :</h2>
Depending on its capabilities, artificial intelligence can be categorized into three different types as follows
<ul>
  <li>Narrow AI</li>
  <li>General AI </li>
  <li>Super AI </li>
  <h2> 1.Narrow AI: </h2>
  One of the types of artificial intelligence that can perform specific and clear tasks, such as self-driving cars, or even speech or image recognition programs, or chess game on smart devices, and this type of artificial intelligence is considered the most common and available today.
    <h2> 2.General AI: </h2>
    which is the type that can work with a capacity similar to the human ability in terms of thinking, as it focuses on making the machine able to think and plan on its own and in a similar way to human thinking, but there are no practical examples of this type, so all there is even Now just research studies need a lot of effort to develop and transform into a reality, and: Artificial Neural Network is one of the methods of studying general artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with the production of a system of neural networks for a machine similar to that contained in the human body.
  <h2> 3.super AI: </h2>
This type may exceed the level of human intelligence, which can do tasks better than that of a specialized and knowledgeable person, and this type has many characteristics that must be included in it; Like the ability to learn, plan, communicate automatically, and make judgments, the concept of super artificial intelligence is considered a hypothetical concept that does not exist in our time.
</ul>
Artificial intelligence can also be classified according to the functions performed by it, as this classification includes four different types as follows
<ul>
  <li>Reactive Machines</li>
  <li>Limited Memory</li>
  <li>Theory of Mind</li>
  <li>Self-Awareness</li>
    <h2> 1.Reactive Machines: </h2>
    The simplest types of artificial intelligence; As this type lacks the ability to learn from past experiences or past experiences to develop future business, it interacts with current experiences to produce them in the best possible way. Examples of this type of artificial intelligence are Deep Blue devices developed by IBM, and the AlphaGo system of the company Google.
  <h2> 2.Limited Memory: </h2>
  This type can store previous experience data for a limited period of time, and the self-driving system is one of the best examples of this type. Where the last speed of other cars is stored, the amount of the vehicleâ€™s distance from other cars, the speed limit, and other data necessary to drive through the roads.
  <h2> 3.Theory of Mind: </h2>
  This type of artificial intelligence is concerned with the machine's understanding of human feelings, interacting with and communicating with people, and it is worth noting that there are currently no practical applications on this type of artificial intelligence.
  <h2> 4.Self-Awareness: </h2>
  This is the kind of future expectation that artificial intelligence seeks, so that machines have self-awareness and special feelings, which will make them more intelligent than the human being, and this concept still does not exist on the ground.
